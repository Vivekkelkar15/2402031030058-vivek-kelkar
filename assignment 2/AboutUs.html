        <h2>Where we started</h2>
        <p>While living abroad, our CEO, Vivek Kelkar, became increasingly aware of the adverse effects of hyper consumerism on the natural environment — landscapes seemingly transformed into seas of plastic. 
        Wanting to make an impactful change in the way we consume, Vivek imagined a marketplace that championed responsible consumerism by only offering sustainable goods. 
        In 2025, GreenHero opened its virtual doors with just a few hundred products to offer sustainable choices for every type of consumer, making sustainable shopping approachable and easy for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Impact Reports</h2>
        <p>At GreenHero, two of our core values are "be transparent" and "be authentic". As a retailer, it's so important to live those values out each and every day. 
        Our customers demand it from us and we believe this is what sets us apart from other retailers when it comes to social & environmental sustainability. 
        One way we have committed to this is by compiling our wins, goals, and dreams in annual impact reports.</p>

        <h2>Measure, Reduce, Offset</h2>
        <p>We measured and offset the prior year’s carbon footprint and reduced our emissions moving forward through this process. 
        We purchased carbon credits through Climate Neutral, which goes towards climate change solutions like renewable energy development and reforestation projects.</p>
